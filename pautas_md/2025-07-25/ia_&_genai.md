* 3. I don't know the area.
* 2. I just started my masters and my supervisor gave me 5 papers to review. Please don't be mad if I mess

## [D] Tried of the same review pattern
Lately, Iâ€™ve been really disappointed with the review process. There seems to be a recurring pattern in the weaknesses reviewers raise, and itâ€™s frustrating:

1. "No novelty" â€“ even when the paper introduces a new idea that beats the state of the art, just because it reuses components from other fie

## [D] [MLOps] How to Handle Accuracy Drop in a Few Models During Mass Migration to a New Container?
Hi all,

Iâ€™m currently facing a challenge in migrating ML models and could use some guidance from the MLOps community.

# Background:

We have around 100 ML models running in production, each serving different clients. These models were trained and deployed using older versions of libraries such as

## [P] ðŸš€Built another 124m parameters transformer based model from scratch.This time with multi GPU training with DDP. Inspired from nanoGPT but redesigned to suit my own training pipeline.Model and training code is here
https://huggingface.co/abhinavv3/MEMGPT

Before training the current code Im planning to experiment by replacing the existing attention layer with GQA and the positional encoding with RoPE. Also tryingg to implement some concepts from research papers like Memorizing Transformers.
Bt these changes ha

## Be careful using Agent
I could see this being a problem for new users in the near future. They mention ChatGPT being vulnerable to clicking on a "prompt attack" when using Agent if you do not have your accounts secure.

## This Agent will do very nicely ... Nice one OpenAI
No wonder they were having compute issues. This Agent works like a beast.  
  
Manus is still able to do some tasks with specific workflow better, create better slides. But the general world capability, knowlegde, I dont think anything compares to ChatGPT Agent, it's a beast locked in many guardrail
