What do you do if it's too early to figure out fail2ban and need to stop crude bot attacks?

## Change My Mind: AI Is Worse For Devs Than Social Media Is To Gen Pop
Title says it all. IMO AI creates a subtle duel decency/reliance we've never seen before:

1. It makes devs FEEL like they are accomplishing so much more, and are so much more advanced by using it. (Dopamine release)
2. It hands off effectively ALL problem solving/deep thinking skills and, instead,

## A script to retrieve content from external sources

## [AskJS] Has anyone here used Node.js cluster + stream with DB calls for large-scale data processing?
I’m working on a data pipeline where I had to process \~5M rows from a MySQL DB and perform some transformation + writeback to another table.

Initially, I used a simple `SELECT *` and looped through everything — but RAM usage exploded and performance tanked.

I tried something new:

## Thoughts on Cinder, performance-oriented version of Python powering Instagram
Regarding [Cinder](https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder), one of their reasons for open-sourcing the code, is
