## I should have chosen to become electrician instead of SWE. If i put the same effort I put into learning and working as electrician I would earn probably about 200k already but in swe for the effort I put in i am unemployed thats the reality of the market.
If anyone is thinking about becoming SWE you should think twice because the effort you put in is not nearly as rewarded in any other career. Go into trades because with half of the effort you would put into becoming swe you would earn twice as much as swe while being electrician.
